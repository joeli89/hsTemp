                        <p>Selfies make it easy to track your body’s progression. Unfortunately, getting in shape takes time 
                        and the only way you can see the small changes is by documenting your fitness journey. Seeing incremental 
                        changes motivates you to carry on and knowing that you have your next Selfie coming up prevents you from going 
                        off track. </p>
