                        <p>Selfies are the only real way to track your body’s progression. Unfortunately, getting in shape takes time 
                        and the only way you can see the small changes is by documenting your fitness journey. Seeing incremental 
                        changes motivates you to carry on and knowing that you have your next Selfie coming up prevents you from going 
                        off track. </p>

                        <p>
                            Write a caption, hashtag whatever you like, and keep track of your chosen measurements. 
                            Hash tagging will enter your image into the fit feed to be shared with all other users.
                             This way, if you're on a diet or training a particular way and seeing great results, 
                             others can discover how you're doing it. You will have chosen the things you want to 
                             track with each picture when you first set up your account, whether that may be weight, 
                             body fat % or number of squats! With each selfie you take, you can capture all of this 
                             in your tracking info. Fancy trying something new today? Simply add a new measurement.
