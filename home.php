		                    	After an incredibly indulgent Christmas holiday we decided our New Year's resolution would be to get back in shape. We thought the best way to get us motivated would be to take a photo of our body - a cruel and bitter taste of reality... It did not disappoint. Although we could both squeeze into the same sized jeans as pre Christmas - the photos highlighted the bare naked truth - we were not looking our best. More importantly, we were not looking healthy. Whether it was vanity, shame or embarrassment - looking at that photo was the best motivation we have ever had.

								We thought what better way way to monitor our progress than to take pictures of ourselves every week to see the changes in our body. The results were amazing - the scales reported no progress, but the images told a totally different story. It only took a few weeks to notice some pretty dramatic changes. We have never felt better in our lives (Charlotte is in better shape than her wedding day!) and as such Healthy Selfie was born. It was our mission to create an app that stores your selfies in one place, allowing you to compare them as you progress towards your goal, whilst inspiring and being inspired by others who are on the same fitness journey as you.

								    I'm Joe. I'm half Chinese, half English. I grew up in England in a family of 6 children and now live in Hong Kong where I moved to manage the family business 2 years ago - stainless steel manufacturing. I have set up several projects since leaving university including a mobile phone accessory franchise in Westfield, London and more recently a mining equipment trading company shipping from China to Zimbabwe. I love sports and fitness (with 2 siblings and a brother in law all working in the fitness industry!)... and over the past year, have embarked on the journey of self taught coding which is where I believe the future lies. Healthy selfie combines all of my passions in one place that I can keep in my pocket - this is the future of healthy living.

								    Born into a family of 3 sisters and an erotic novelist from Trinidad for a mum, I now live and work full time in Hong Kong....as an auditor. I spend 90% of my salary on food, wine and the next fad health craze. I live life on the never ending female diet train - Dukan, Atkins, 5:2, Paleo - you name it. I am by no means overweight - I'm just permanently seeking to slim down my thighs and tone up my abs. After a busy year in 2013 getting married to my husband Joe, going on Honeymoon and finishing with a very indulgent Christmas - I took the plunge and asked Joe to take a snap of me in bra and pants to give me the kick up the arse I needed to get back in shape..... the photo was a mortifying reality shock...there were tears....and Healthy Selfie was born....
